Title - Cape Town Municipal Portal

Overview:
The Cape Town Municipal Portal is a web application designed to enable residents of Cape Town to report and view municipal issues while staying informed with community events and announcements.

Features:
Home page - This displays general information about the municipal and gives live information on the total issues, most recent issues and pending issues. This page is designed to guide the user and assist them with the features.

Report Issues - This page consists of 2 forms, one that enables the user to input and submit information about an issue. The 2nd form gives the user tips to submitting issues.

View Issues - This page enables the user to view all the issues on the portal. The user can filter by the category and search by the description of the issue. The issue cards display the category, location, description, status and date submitted of the issue.

Features coming in the future:
Local Events & Announcements
Service Request Status

Technologies used:
C# visual studio
HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
File Handling - Stores the image/document attachments
Custom Data Structure - I created a custom linked list called IssueLinkedList to store the information regarding the issues.
ASP.NET Core MVC framework

Static data:
	I have prepopulated the application with 2 issues for demo purposes. This is so the live data on the amount of issues and pending issues is accurate and different.

Application usage:
After the application is running, a user can simply view the home page and all the features that are available at the moment. Each feature is described clearly to limit confusion. There is a navigation bar at the top of the application to provide simple and smooth transitions between pages. Each form clearly indicates its functionality.
